# AI-Driven-Maintenance-Assistant-Development
Creating an AI-driven maintenance assistant requires building a system that can predict potential failures, optimize maintenance schedules, and centralize operational knowledge. Below is an outline of the Python code for such a system using machine learning and AI techniques.

In this example, we will simulate predictive maintenance using machine learning and provide a basic structure to help optimize maintenance schedules. The system can analyze sensor data, predict failures, and recommend when to perform maintenance tasks.
Requirements:

    Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
    Scikit-learn for machine learning
    Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
    SQLite or a similar database for storing maintenance data and operational knowledge

Step 1: Install Required Libraries

First, install the necessary libraries:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn sqlite3

Step 2: Data Simulation and Preprocessing

We'll start by simulating a dataset for predictive maintenance. In real-world scenarios, you'd gather sensor data, such as temperature, pressure, and vibration readings, and use that to predict failure.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
import sqlite3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Simulating maintenance data (in real-world, this would come from sensors)
np.random.seed(42)

# Simulate some sensor data (e.g., temperature, pressure, vibration)
n_samples = 1000
data = {
    'temperature': np.random.normal(loc=50, scale=10, size=n_samples),
    'pressure': np.random.normal(loc=30, scale=5, size=n_samples),
    'vibration': np.random.normal(loc=3, scale=1, size=n_samples),
    'failure': np.random.choice([0, 1], size=n_samples)  # 0 = No failure, 1 = Failure
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Preprocess data (e.g., scaling, handling missing values)
# In this case, we don't need to scale since the data is already in a reasonable range

# Split data into training and testing sets
X = df.drop('failure', axis=1)  # Features
y = df['failure']  # Target variable (failure prediction)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

Step 3: Building the Predictive Model

We'll use a Random Forest classifier to predict failures based on the sensor data.

# Build a Random Forest Classifier model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print("Model Performance:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Feature importance analysis
importances = model.feature_importances_
features = X.columns

# Visualize feature importance
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.barplot(x=importances, y=features)
plt.title("Feature Importance for Predicting Failure")
plt.show()

Step 4: Predictive Maintenance Functionality

The model is now capable of predicting failures based on sensor data. To implement the assistant's functionality, we would add predictive maintenance, failure prediction, and maintenance schedule optimization.

def predict_failure(sensor_data):
    """
    Predict whether a failure will occur based on input sensor data.
    
    Args:
        sensor_data (dict): Sensor readings for the equipment.
        
    Returns:
        str: A message indicating whether maintenance is needed.
    """
    # Convert sensor data to a DataFrame
    sensor_df = pd.DataFrame([sensor_data])

    # Predict using the trained model
    prediction = model.predict(sensor_df)
    
    if prediction[0] == 1:
        return "Failure predicted. Immediate maintenance required!"
    else:
        return "No failure predicted. Regular maintenance recommended."

# Example sensor data
sensor_data = {
    'temperature': 55,
    'pressure': 32,
    'vibration': 4
}

print(predict_failure(sensor_data))

Step 5: Centralizing Operational Knowledge

We can store maintenance history and failure predictions in a database like SQLite for easy access.

# Create a SQLite database to store maintenance records
def create_db():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('maintenance_records.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Create a table for storing records
    cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS maintenance (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        sensor_data TEXT,
        prediction INTEGER,
        date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    )''')
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

# Save a maintenance record in the database
def save_record(sensor_data, prediction):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('maintenance_records.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Insert data into the maintenance table
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO maintenance (sensor_data, prediction) VALUES (?, ?)",
                   (str(sensor_data), prediction))
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

# Example of saving a record
prediction = 1  # Assume failure is predicted
save_record(sensor_data, prediction)

# Retrieve records from the database
def get_maintenance_records():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('maintenance_records.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Fetch all records
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM maintenance")
    records = cursor.fetchall()
    
    conn.close()
    return records

# Display records
for record in get_maintenance_records():
    print(record)

Step 6: Optimizing Maintenance Schedules

Optimizing maintenance schedules can be done using historical data and failure predictions. For simplicity, we can use the failure prediction model to suggest maintenance intervals.

from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def optimize_maintenance_schedule(last_maintenance_date, failure_prediction):
    """
    Recommend the next maintenance date based on failure prediction.
    
    Args:
        last_maintenance_date (str): Date of the last maintenance.
        failure_prediction (int): Prediction of failure (0 = no failure, 1 = failure).
        
    Returns:
        str: Recommended next maintenance date.
    """
    last_maintenance_date = datetime.strptime(last_maintenance_date, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    
    # If failure is predicted, recommend immediate maintenance
    if failure_prediction == 1:
        next_maintenance_date = datetime.now()
    else:
        # If no failure is predicted, schedule maintenance in 30 days
        next_maintenance_date = last_maintenance_date + timedelta(days=30)
    
    return next_maintenance_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

# Example: Get the next maintenance schedule
last_maintenance_date = '2024-02-01 12:30:00'
next_maintenance = optimize_maintenance_schedule(last_maintenance_date, 1)
print(f"Next recommended maintenance date: {next_maintenance}")

Step 7: Final Remarks

This AI-driven maintenance assistant has the following functionalities:

    Predictive failure detection based on sensor data.
    Data storage and centralization for operational knowledge.
    Maintenance schedule optimization based on predicted failures.

You can expand this system by integrating more advanced machine learning algorithms (e.g., deep learning for anomaly detection), adding real-time sensor data input, and improving the scheduling optimization algorithm based on more detailed operational constraints.
Next Steps:

    Integrate real-time sensor data collection (IoT integration).
    Enhance failure prediction with more sophisticated models (e.g., neural networks).
    Implement a web dashboard or mobile app for user interaction and notifications.

This should provide a solid foundation for developing a predictive maintenance assistant that streamlines maintenance operations and improves system reliability.
